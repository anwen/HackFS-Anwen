# HackFS-Anwen

A decentralized content platform/community which storage data in IPFS to avoid boring 404 and reward authors and valuable readers with FileCoin/LikeCoin.

We are in an virtual Hackathon named [HackFS](https://hackfs.com/), helping building the foundation for the decentralized web.

## How It Works
- If you are an author/creator/blogger/podcaster/vlogger eth, you can send your works in our decentralized content platform. We help you storage your works in IPFS/FileCoin network to avoid 404. 
- And we will help you gain more FileCoin and LikeCoin if you need. Nice readers will gain FileCoin/LikeCoin too.
- As it is a open-source decentralized content platform/community, community driven is used.
- We also will have API which is easy to use.
- We are designing better version of RSS-with-incentive, so sites/apps can exchange data.
- We are trying to be a real open Web3 ecosystem booster.
