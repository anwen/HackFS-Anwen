# Anwen Redesign

I have designed Anwen many times. Redesign it from scratch now.

## Features remains
- A writing and reading platform
- Open-source
- Community-Driven-Community
- Incentives for creators with LikeCoin

## Features will done in HackFS
- Storage data in ipfs/filecoin elegant  3 days
- Incentives for creators with FileCoin  3 days
- Decentralization of all the community data 2 days

## Features will done after HackFS
- API which is easy to use
- Incentives for people who share
- Incentived RSS
- Using the open data, such as wikipedia and api of matters.news

## Plan
- Test js/grpc/python api of ipfs and filecoin/lotus-devnet  1 week
- First web demo (storage data in ipfs/filecoin elegant)   3 days
- Incentives for creators with FileCoin  3 days
- Decentralization of all the community data 2 days

## Thought
- DID(Decentralized Identity) Problem , Maybe we will skip it in HackFS
- IPFS and IPNS and IPLD (such as: how to point to new version of my articles?)

## Tools
