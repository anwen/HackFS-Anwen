# Information and Knowledge

-- written by askender in Anwen Team

## A brief history

We care about knowledge sharing. It makes us happy. So we use language, book, Internet, www/w2c, Wikipedia, Github, Arxiv, IPFS, Web3, etc.

We care about knowledge storage. It makes us can talk to genius in old times and the future. There are too many 404, so we use stone, FileCoin, etc.

We care about knowledge-creating. People are struggling for money (which can be used to buy basic resources and time to create). People are too painful to create. We try to give money to creators and sharers as much as we can. No good tools. Money is in rich guys. So I create Anwen and use LikeCoin and other payment to support creators and sharers.

Imagine a world in which everyone has enough resources. People have time trying to find what they love. People share anything without a burden. In that world, I will only be watching, reading, listening, thinking, creating. In that world, I will research artificial intelligence happily.

I work in NLP(Natural Language Processing) and Artificial Intelligence areas for years. I wrote some papers and products. I think it is a good tool for us. But the world is becoming more centralized.

I want to speedup decentralization. I will work for my dream directly. Even I still don't have enough resources and will very poor if I am unlucky.

## About the dream? 
Anwen, support creators, and sharers. We will give them money. We help people finding what they love intelligently and efficiently.

## Where is the money come from?
- Lovely readers of our platform/community, Angel investors, people who support Web3/IPFS/decentralization.
- I will sell our open-source platform/community software to business users.
- Hackers, geeks, dreamers, idealists

## In the end
- Let's create a more decentralized world which is interesting.
- To be or not to be, It is a problem. No longer.
- Time is not enough for love. Hack the world.
